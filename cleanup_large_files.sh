The following steps were performed:
1. Created a backup branch: $BACKUP_BRANCH
2. Removed large files from Git history
3. Force pushed the cleaned repository (if you chose to)

Next steps:
1. Make sure your .gitignore file includes the patterns for large files
2. Inform your team members to pull the latest changes and reset their local repositories
3. Team members should run: git fetch && git reset --hard origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH
